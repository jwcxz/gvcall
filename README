INTRODUCTION

    gvcall is a simple utility to make a phone call with Google Voice from the
    command line.  The major feature of this program is to integrate Google
    Voice and Linphone's command-line mode to make calling a number easy.


SETUP

    0. If you don't already have a way to receive incoming calls to a VoIP
       account, see these instructions on my blog:

            http://blog.jwcxz.com/?p=599

       I use Antisip and IPKALL to achieve this.

    1. Setup Linphone with your SIP server information (again, see the link
       above for more detailed instructions).

    2. Get pygooglevoice at:

            http://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/
            AUR Package: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=38993

    3. Install gvcall wherever you want and run it with no arguments.  This
       will create a default configuration file at ~/.gvcall

    4. Edit ~/.gvcall using the instructions provided in the comments.

    5. Run gvcall -h for a list of options, or to get started right away, just
       do gvcall phonenumber


NOTES
    Other Functionality
        You can also add other phone numbers to call with using a simple alias
        system in ~/.gvcall.  For example, say that you sometimes have your
        mobile phone next to you and want to call a number using that.  You
        could set altnums to be 

            altnums=mobile:5555555555

        and then run gvcal -m mobile phonenumber

    Passwordless Access
        pygooglevoice provides a configuration file at ~/.gvoice where you can
        enter your Google username and password if you don't want to be
        prompted every time you want to make a call.
